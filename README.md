# (Odin) Signup form

A mockup signup form of an imaginary website. This is a test of my skills regarding:
  - Usage of different tags like \<form>, \<label>, \<input>, etc.
  - Usage of the attributes of said tags, like action, method, for, name, type, etc.
  - Different types of inputs and how to handle them
  - Client-side validation
  - UI and UX form design
